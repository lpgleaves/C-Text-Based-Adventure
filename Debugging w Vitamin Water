"sight of a flannel-clad young man", you don't just stand in a dude, that's weird

make it say 0 HP for defeated enemies instead of something <0

for push harder/look around/take a nap, need a toupper()

huge tree --> print new health

bring it to the cave --> south instead of southeast

no south if 9 or 10 (part 1)

"you journey to the edge of the kingdom" part 1, get rid of weird line break
